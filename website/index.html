                      <strong>Gold Roger</strong> was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the
                      Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change
                      throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in
                      the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who
                      dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite
                      possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King. Enter <strong>Monkey Luffy</strong>, a 17-year-old boy who
                      defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened,
                      toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun, Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the
                      thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised
                      treasure. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand
                      Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order
                      to reach the most coveted of all fortunes.
